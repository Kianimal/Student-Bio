    <p>This is a short example paragraph about myself. 
        It would include things like my hobbies, my interests, my career and my goals.
        It would also include things about my social life, perhaps, such as  where I like to spend my time
        and what I like to spend it doing, and maybe with whom. Perhaps even something about my family!</p>
